  <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Yusuf Akyavas, and I am a current student in the Bachelor of Information Technology course at RMIT. I was born in Australia from two Turkish parents. I have two older brothers and we all speak both English and Turkish together, it varies from time to time. I went to a private school called Sirius College and spent my entire primary and secondary education there and graduated with a year 12 Certificate. I really enjoy playing video games and other tabletop games as well. The type of video games I play varies but I mostly enjoy playing cooperative games in which I can play with friends because I believe that experiences with other people are much more enjoyable than on your own. I also have two cats. Their names are Kestane which translates to “chestnut” in Turkish and Kimba which is from “Kimba The White Lion”(He is a white cat).</p>
  <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
    <p>My interest in IT started since a young age. My brothers are a lot older than me and so they had access to technology and devices which I did not. I would always enjoy watching them play a game and began wondering why it worked that way. As I got older I started to try and understand how changing something in the code changes the games or websites experience, but I was never fully invested. I only started getting really interested in the past few years as a result of the Covid-19 lockdown and I was spending more time on the computer.
This led to wanting to go to university with a bachelors or Information Technology. I chose to go to RMIT as it was the university that my oldest brother had gone to for his education in IT and he taught me about IT. It was also the easiest to go to as the other universities were very far away.
From this IT course I hopefully will learn a broad range of knowledge which I can apply to my career and personal life and use the skills gained to help people in the field of IT. I would like to continually learn and grow and develop my IT skills for use in the future.</p>
